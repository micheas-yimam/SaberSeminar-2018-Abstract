# SaberSeminar-2018-Abstract

The goal of my investigation was to find whether being drafted out of college or high school would relate to performance in the Majors. 

In this directory you will find the data I used, and the R code I used for the analysis.

Along with my powerpoint presentation and video from the presentation at SaberSeminar 2018.
